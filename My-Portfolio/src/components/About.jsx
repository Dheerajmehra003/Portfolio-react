        <p>
          Graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer application. 
          <br />
           I am eager to start my career as a React Developer. I have a solid
          foundation <br />
          in front-end development, particularly with react where Iâ€™ve honed my
          skills <br />
          through various projects and coursework. In addition to my technical
          skills,
          <br />
          I am a strong communicator and acollaborative team player. I thrive in
          <br />
          environments where I can continuously learn and contributeto
          innovative
          <br />
          solutions. I am particularly excited about opportunities to work on challenging
          <br />
          projects and to grow within a dynamic team.
